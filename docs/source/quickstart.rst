Running a Scenario
------------------

To run a scenario, first create two terminal windows. In the first one, change into your Carla directory. 
Run the command ``./CarlaUE4.sh`` to start your Carla Engine. Now, in the other window, you can run the command 
``python3 EI_Drive.py`` to start a scenario, default being ``demo``. 

To change to scenario being ran, add the argument ``test_scenario=`` with the name of the test scenario that 
you want to run.
